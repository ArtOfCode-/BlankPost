    <h1>500 Internal Server Error</h1>
    <p><strong>The server encountered an error or misconfiguration and was unable to complete your request.</strong></p>
    <h3>Why am I seeing this?</h3>
    <p>You've been sent to this page because the software that powers this website encountered an error. Additionally, 
    another error was encountered while trying to serve you a slightly nicer error page, so we've had to fall back to 
    this page.</p>
    <h3>What should I do?</h3>
    <p>This is an error within the software that's behind this website. This can be caused by the site not being 
    entirely configured yet, in which case you should come back in a while when the owner has finished configuring the 
    site. It's also possible that there's a bug in the software, in which case you should tell the website owner so that
    they can contact the vendor.</p>
